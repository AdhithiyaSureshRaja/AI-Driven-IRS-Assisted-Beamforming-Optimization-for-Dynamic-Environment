Essential Columns for Synthetic IRS Dataset (SISO, Rayleigh Fading)

# Synthetic IRS Dataset Features (SISO, Rayleigh Fading)

**Note:**
- The dataset now consists of 100 separate CSV files (episode_000.csv, ..., episode_099.csv), each representing a unique user trajectory (episode) with 100 time steps.
- Each file contains the following columns. The `trajectory_id` column has been removed (each file is a unique trajectory).
- For this dataset, N = 8 (number of IRS elements).
- **Obstacle Emulation:** To better reflect real-world scenarios, additional columns are included to represent obstacles between the user and base station. These columns allow for simulating the presence, position, and size of obstacles that justify IRS usage.
- For simplicity let us assume a circular trajectory not particularly around anything but simply so that it would be easier to predict.

**Justification for Including Obstacle Features:**

The inclusion of obstacle-related features is motivated by the fundamental role of IRS in overcoming blockages in wireless communication environments. Obstacles such as buildings, walls, and other objects can block the line-of-sight (LoS) path between the transmitter (base station) and receiver (user), severely degrading the received signal quality. IRS is specifically proposed to mitigate such issues by providing alternative, reconfigurable reflection paths.
