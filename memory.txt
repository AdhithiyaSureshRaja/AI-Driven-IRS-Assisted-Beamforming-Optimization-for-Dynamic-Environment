# Global Rules and Project Requirements

##### Important Notes #####
0. I AM NOT MAKING AN APP OR WEBSITE 
1. No additional files or notebooks allowed beyond the 4 specified files(dataset.py , dataste_visuals.py - to pick a random episode and show the user trajectory in 100 frames , ddpg_train.py for training the model and then save the trained info weights , ddpg_test_visuals.py for picking a random episode out of the 100 to give the necessary graphs for )
2. ALWAYS ANALYZE BEFORE YOU EDIT ANYTHING , ANALYZE THE ENTIRE CODEBASE BEFORE EDITTING
3. REFER TO THE PAPERS FOR THE FORMULATIONS AND DETAILS OF THE CODE AND THE DATASET , ALWAYS WRITE A COMMENT BEFORE THE CODE SNIPPET AS TO WHY YOU WROTE THIS CODE AND WHAT YOU REFERED TO WRITE THIS PIECE OF CODE , THIS WILL MAKE YOU NO HALUCINATE AND ALWAYS HAVE A BASIS AS TO WHY YOU DO WHAT YOU DO. 

## Dataset Requirements
1. Generate synthetic dataset with:
   - 100 episodes
   - 100 frames per episode
   - Fixed components in all episodes:
     * 1 IRS plane with 8 IRS elements (fixed location)
     * 1 Access Point (fixed location)
     * 1 Rectangular obstacle (fixed location, size and  height)
   - Variable components:
     * 1 Moving user with different trajectories per episode
   Note: 
   *MAKE MOST EPISODE WITH THE NOTION THAT THE USER IS BLOCKED BY THE BUILDING AND SO THE SINR FROM THE ANTENNA IS LOWER COMAPRED TO THE IRS SINR . MAKE THE SINR USAGE AROUND 40% to 90% for each episode*

## Directory Structure
1. Source Code    
- Python Files:
     * generate_dataset.py
     * visualize_dataset.py
     * train_ddpg.py
     * visualize_ddpg.py
   
   
## Implementation Requirements
1. Dataset Generator:
   - Based on dataset_features.txt
   - Generate 1000 episodes with specified components
   - A big building usually blocking Direct Line of Sight of the Antenna.
   - User moves like a normal human on the ground (Sometimes in LOS of the Antenna , Sometimes in no LOS of the Antenna but LOS with the IRS , Sometimes not LOS with both in which case best SINR is chosen)
   - Make most episodes with the agenda that the SINR from Antenna should be lower compared to SINR from the IRS , Achieve this by either making distance between user and Ap larger or by make the user move where the obstacle is blocking direct LOS of the user from the Antenna , just make this a higher probability of occurrence as in real life obviously some user may be nearer to the antenna compared to the IRS )  


2. Dataset Visualizer:
   - 3D visualization of episodes
   - Show user movement, IRS panel, base station, obstacle
   - Dotted lines showing signal path (IRS or direct)
   - I want the visualization to be a fig with 100 frames as the user moves 

3. DDPG Trainer:
   - Train for 100 episodes
      - Objectives:
     * Maximize main lobe and steer to user location
     * Minimize side lobes
     * Optimize user SINR
     * Use IRS path only when SINR is higher than direct path

4. DDPG Visualizer:
   Required visualizations:
   a) Side-by-side animation:
      - 3D movement with components and signal paths
      - Polar plot of main lobe tracking
   b) SINR vs BER with multiple modulation techniques
   c) User distance vs SINR comparison (IRS vs direct path)
   d) Phase shift graph showing main lobe steering
   e) IRS elements vs SINR relationship study
   f) Phase shift vs Time
